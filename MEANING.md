# Meaning

One contributions is either just one commit in a version control system or one edit in a Mediawiki.
It doesn't say anything about the quality of that commit, how much time was invested, how complicated the task was.

Sometimes you start using a new program, find a bug, or something that doesn't work like you want it to.
You decide to fix it but you don't know the language and it's small caveats, you don't know the build system and the tooling.
So you learn all that, then make your fix. You spend hours maybe, but learned so much.

Or you just saw a spelling error, clone the repo and correct it. It took 2 minutes. It wasn't very hard. But still it improved something. And it shows that you care enough to fix small details.

You find a nice program written in the language you are most familiar with. You implement some new features. The area of the program is quite new to you so you learn a lot about the subject and try to implement it in a nice way.

So creating such an overview and showing you contributions can show many things. Not just your skill level and knowledge about a certain language, but also about your willingness to invest time for others, to improve things, to care for details.

## What is tracked
In case of hg, git etc. we just run (the equivalent) of `git log` and search for the email adress. Each commit from this email adress is one commit.
In case of Mediawiki we use the API to get the statistics of a user.

## What is not tracked
Like I said, one contributions is one commit/edit. This means so many things are left out. Maybe you comment a lot on a bug tracker, testing programs and trying to find the cause of a problem.

Maybe you review a lot of code, make suggestions about changes to it. Comment on pull requests on GitHub etc.

In the case of OBS, it could be that you maintain a devel project, so you review and accept/decline the changes of others.
